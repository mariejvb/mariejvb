### About

I am a senior Electrical and Computer Engineering undergraduate student at the University of Washington with an interest in hardware development, systems engineering, and project management. Currently located in Seattle, I am exploring opportunities in the greater Seattle area as well as the UK, where I spent 9 months studying in the Electronic and Electrical Engineering department at University College London.
